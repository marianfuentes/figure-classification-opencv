This file contains definition of class object "imageShape".
It allows to receive from user two values of height and width image.

Methods
generateShape:
    It generates and saves image with height and width received.
    It also draws a centered figure (choosing between triangle, rectangle, rotated square or circle) randomly.
    
showShape:
    shows image with figure drawed.
    If there's no image it shows a black image.

getShape:
    returns figure image and figure name
    
whatShape:
    receives an image with a figure (black background and clear object)
    Classifies the image between triangle, rectangle, square and circle.
    Returns the name of the classified figure.
